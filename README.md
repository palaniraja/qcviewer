A single purpose webpage to view my xlsx export to a more readable format. 

A quick hack of [sheetjs](https://github.com/SheetJS/sheetjs) sample code to meet my requirement.



### localstorage

`orOrand` - It can be either `0` (for OR - default) or `1` (for AND)

`template` - It can be either `0` (for summary template - default ) or `1` for list template
